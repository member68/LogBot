A simple IRC logging bot that resides in the single channel that is in the config.

This bot was originally made for ##reddit-android-developers on freenode but it can be used anywhere else

The config file gets auto-generated on first-start, try and replace the values called "pleasereplace" if 
applicable, hopefully the keys should be mostly self-explaining.

This bot requires the PIRCbot library that can be found at http://www.jibble.org/pircbot.php
